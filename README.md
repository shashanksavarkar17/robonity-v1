## üîå Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and `npm` installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Firebase Setup (Required)

This project requires a Firebase backend to run.

1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2.  **Add a Web App:** Click the `</>` icon to add a new web app to your project.
3.  **Register App:** Give it a nickname and click "Register app".
4.  **Copy Config:** Firebase will give you a `firebaseConfig` object. Copy this object.
5.  **Enable Services:**
    * In the Firebase console, go to **Authentication** -> **Sign-in method** -> and enable **Email/Password**.
    * Go to **Firestore Database** -> **Create database** -> and start in **Test Mode**.
6.  **Create Config File:** In your project's `src/` folder, create a new file named `firebase.js`.
7.  **Paste your config** into `src/firebase.js` using this template:

    ```javascript
    // src/firebase.js

    import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
    import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
    import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";

    // Your web app's Firebase configuration
    const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
      authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
      projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
      storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
      messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
      appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
    };

    // Initialize Firebase
    const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

    // Initialize and export Firebase services
    export const auth = getAuth(app);
    export const db = getFirestore(app);
    export default app;
    ```

### Run the App

After installing dependencies and setting up Firebase, run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
